## Output, Outcome, and Impact

Output and outcome are not a regular part of most peopleâ€™s vocabulary, but impact is. Impact can be a troublesome word for many who are new to the world of social problem-solving because the word impact can be used in various situations throughout everyday conversation. When describing what outputs, outcomes, and impact are, it's helpful to start with outputs, followed by outcomes, and then impact.

**Output**: These are the immediate, tangible products or services generated by a program or activity. Outputs are often quantifiable and directly attributable to the actions taken. For example, the number of workshops conducted, reports published, or people trained are considered outputs.

If the result is a measurement of the negative consequences of the social problem then the result is an outcome. All other measurement or evaluation results are outputs.

Two Basic Types of Outputs

Common outputs: these tend to be simple counts like the following: - number of people working with GEOGLOWS - number of countries using GEOGLOWS - number of GEOGLOWS trainings - number of applications that use data from GEOGLOWS

Another type of output is nuanced outputs. These provide additional insights and help us understand the nuance of stakeholder relationships and needs. Some stakeholders do not finish a set of courses. Others may find that the intervention is not helping them. They are often described as percentages giving us averages and other simple statistical information like the following:
* percent of river systems with accurate streamflow forecasts
* percent of stakeholders needing GEOGLOWS services but lack the resources to access them
* percent of regions experiencing improved water management and reduced flood risk
* percent of regions with increased water security and availability
* percent of regions previously facing water scarcity now experiencing sustainable water levels
* etc.

**Outcomes**: These are the short- and medium-term effects or changes that result from the outputs. Outcomes reflect the extent to which the program or activity has achieved its objectives and can include changes in behavior, attitudes, knowledge, skills, or conditions. For example, increased knowledge about water conservation practices among participants who attended a workshop.

Outcomes are the ultimate results we aim to achieve, reflecting the impact or changes brought about by our efforts. On the other hand, outputs measure the tangible products or services delivered, serving as the means through which we strive to reach those desired outcomes. For example, if a hydrological intervention leads to a measurable decrease in the frequency and severity of flooding in a region, that result is an outcome. All other measurements or evaluation results are outputs.

Knowing the difference between these two things is important to measuring impact. 

**Impact**: This refers to the long-term, significant changes that occur as a result of the program or activity. Impact is broader and more enduring, often reflecting fundamental shifts in conditions or systems. Unlike outputs and outcomes, impact is less directly attributable to specific activities and can be influenced by various factors. For example, improved water quality and availability in a region due to sustained water conservation efforts.
