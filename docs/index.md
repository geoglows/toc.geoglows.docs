## THE SOCIAL IMPACT MODEL FOR GLOBAL HYDROLOGICAL MODELS

Social Impact refers to the effects of activities, organizations, or policies on community well-being, covering areas like the economy, environment, health, education, and social cohesion. This approach facilitates continuous feedback and iteration throughout the process, promoting effective co-creation.

This model is based on the Theory of Change which links social needs with the GEOGLOWS model. Despite the advanced capabilities of current hydrological models, there is a significant gap between these models and the actual needs of the communities they are intended to serve. This disconnection arises primarily because the development of these models often lacks meaningful engagement with local populations and stakeholders. To bridge this gap GEOGLOWS attempts for the first time to include the Theory of Change (ToC).

The BYU Hydroinformatics team focuses on tackling water-related challenges through advanced data science, hydrologic modeling, and innovative technological solutions. This team is instrumental in developing tools like the GEOGLOWS ECMWF Streamflow Hydrologic Model, which helps forecast and manage water resources, particularly in regions vulnerable to flooding, drought, and other climate-related water issues. In collaboration with partners, including the BYU Ballard Center that focuses solely on addressing social issues, the Hydroinformatics team designs projects that address immediate water needs while empowering communities through technology and education. Their work goes beyond technical solutions, aiming to build community capacity for long-term, sustainable water management and resilience in the face of climate challenges.
