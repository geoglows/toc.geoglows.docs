### *What is the purpose of this model?* 

The model evaluates the social impact by integrating the GEOGLOWS Hydrology Model with specific needs of National Hydrological Services around the world.  

### *How does the model work?* 

The model combines hydrologic information like forecast or retrospect information with socio-economic data (e.g., population, infrastructure) in order to measure the impact of implementation of GEOGLOWS. 

### *What are the phases of the Social Impact Model?* 

1. Assessment 
2. Planning & Design 
3. Implementation & Adaptation 
4. Expansion & Equity 

### *What does the slogan “Love the Problem, Not the Solution” mean?* 

This slogan refers to the idea that those who want to make real, lasting impact need to work to understand the problem, rather than immediately offering a solution. They need to understand the people, and be open to iterations and changes as their understanding develops.
