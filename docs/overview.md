## THE SOCIAL IMPACT MODEL FOR GLOBAL HYDROLOGICAL MODELS

Social Impact refers to the effects of activities, organizations, or policies on community well-being, covering areas like the economy, environment, health, education, and social cohesion. This approach facilitates continuous feedback and iteration throughout the process, promoting effective co-creation.

This model is based on the Theory of Change which links social needs with the GEOGLOWS model. Despite the advanced capabilities of current hydrological models, there is a significant gap between these models and the actual needs of the communities they are intended to serve. This disconnection arises primarily because the development of these models often lacks meaningful engagement with local populations and stakeholders. To bridge this gap GEOGLOWS attempts for the first time to include the Theory of Change (ToC).
